# C# Code Challenge
A Simple console app made for a VanHack C# code challenge. 

On the challenge I had to code the "openAndClosePrices" method with its pre-made signature. 
I wasn't allowed to change the rest of the code or add new assemblies, that's why I did synchronous calls to the Web API.
The code here is in the same shape as the one I submitted to VanHack.

### Features
